 * are sufficient for most applications, some will want to use a different
 * destination manager.
 * IMPORTANT: we assume that fwrite() will correctly transcribe an array of
 * JOCTETs into 8-bit-wide elements on external storage.  If char is wider
 * than 8 bits on your machine, you may need to do some tweaking.
